# Summary

* Bartik instrument can be interpreted as exogenous shock IV with endogenous exposure shares.  
* Orthogonality: Shock level unobservable $\bar{\epsilon}_{n}$ and mean-exposure-multiplied shocks $s_{n}g_{n}$.  
* Can use usual IV commands for estimation and inference once data is transformed. 
* Need large number of sectors $N$ and dispersed shocks for cross section data.  
* Need large number of sectors $N$ and location $L$ for short panels, need large $T$ and small $L, N$ for long panels.  


# Intro

Bartik instrument: In each locality $l$, weighted mean of sector wise shocks $g_{n}$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
y_{l}
&=
\alpha + \beta x_{l}+\gamma'w_{l}+\epsilon_{l},\\
x_{l}
&=
a_{0}+a_{1}z_{l}+a'_{2}w_{l}+\omicron_{l}, \quad z_{l}=\sum_{n}s_{ln}g_{n},
\end{aligned}
$$

* $y_{l}$: Wage growth in locality $l$.
* $x_{l}$: Employment growth at $l$.
* $s_{ln}$: Lagged employment share of industry $n$ of location $l$ to total employment of $l$.  
* $g_{n}$: Aggregate shocks on industry $n$.  
* $w_{l}$: A covariate vector.  

$x_{l}$ is endogenous as demand and supply factors affect it. Need an instrument that is orthogonal to supply shocks. Bartik IV.

# BHJ's interpretation of Bartik instruments

IV
$$
z_{l}=\sum_{n}s_{ln}g_{n}.
$$
Bartik moment condition
$$
\mathbb E\left[\sum_{l}e_{l}z_{l}\epsilon_{l}\right]=0.
$$

* $e_{l}$: Total employment of location $l$ to US total.  

This moment condition suggests an estimator:
\begin{equation}
\hat{\beta}=\frac{\sum\limits_{l}e_{l}z_{l}y^{\perp}_{l}}{\sum\limits_{l}e_{l}z_{l}x^{\perp}_{l}}
\tag{4}\label{eqn4}
\end{equation}

* $y^{\perp}_{l}$: Residuals from projection of $y_{l}$ on $w_{l}$.  

## Insights

Shock-level orthogonality
$$
\begin{aligned}
E\left[\sum_{l}e_{l}z_{l}\epsilon_{l}\right]
&=
E\left[\sum_{l}e_{l}\sum_{n}s_{ln}g_{n}\epsilon_{l}\right]
=
E\left[\sum_{n}\sum_{l}e_{l}s_{ln}g_{n}\epsilon_{l}\right],\\
&=
E\left[\sum\limits_{n}g_{n}\frac{\sum\limits_{l}e_{l}s_{ln}\epsilon_{l}}{\sum\limits_{l}e_{l}s_{ln}}\sum\limits_{l}e_{l}s_{ln}\right],\\
&=
E\left[\sum_{n}s_{n}g_{n}\bar{\epsilon}_{n}\right],  \quad \Leftarrow s_{n}=\sum_{l}e_{l}s_{ln}, \bar{\epsilon}_{n}=\sum\limits_{l}\frac{e_{l}s_{ln}\epsilon_{l}}{\sum\limits_{l}e_{l}s_{ln}}\\
&=
0 \quad \Leftarrow \mbox{Need }s_{n}g_{n}\perp\bar{\epsilon}_{n}.
\end{aligned}
$$
Exposure weighted (supply) shocks to be orthogonal to mean employment share $\times$ industry shocks. Tough to understand. But exogenous industry shocks are not too difficult to find.  

GSS (2020)'s interpretation of Bartik IV identification: Exogenous (or random) shares $s_{ln}$ and nonrandom $g_{n}$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
E\left[\sum_{n}\sum_{l}e_{l}s_{ln}g_{n}\epsilon_{l}\right]
&=
\sum_{n}g_{n}E\left[\sum_{l}e_{l}s_{ln}\epsilon_{l}\right], \quad \Leftarrow \mbox{Non random }g_{n}\\
&=
0 \quad \Leftarrow \mbox{Need }e_{l}s_{ln}\perp\epsilon_{l}.
\end{aligned}
$$
This is unlikely to hold. 

## Main results

Shock-level orthogonality leads to shock-level estimation.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar{y}^{\perp}_{n}
&=
\alpha +\beta \bar{x}^{\perp}_{n} + \bar{\epsilon}^{\perp}_{n},\\
x^{\perp}_{n}
&=
a_{0}+a_{1}g_{n}+\omicron_{n}.
\end{aligned}
$$
Given below, one can estimate $\beta$ by:  

1. Construct covariate vector $w_{l}=(\tilde{w}_{l}, \grave{w}_{l})$ with shock-level covariates $\tilde{w}_{l}=\sum\limits_{n}s_{ln}q_{n}$ and observation-level covariates $\grave{w}_{l}$.
1. Get residuals $x^{\perp}_{l}, y^{\perp}_{l}$ from projection of $x,y$ on $w$.  
1. Transform residuals using $\bar{x}^{\perp}_{n}=\frac{\sum\limits_{l}e_{l}s_{ln}x^{\perp}_{l}}{\sum\limits_{l}e_{l}s_{ln}}$.  
1. Multiply $\bar{x}^{\perp}_{n}, \bar{y}^{\perp}_{n}$ with weights $s_{n}$.
1. Use $g_{n}$ as an IV to the above estimating equation using $s_{n}\bar{x}^{\perp}_{n}, s_{n}\bar{y}^{\perp}_{n}$.  
1. Do robust (SE) inference.  

This is OK, because, starting from \eqref{eqn4}, we end up using $g_{n}$ as an IV on $s_{n}\bar{x}^{\perp}_{n}$ with $s_{n}\bar{y}^{\perp}_{n}$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\beta}
&=
\frac{\sum\limits_{l}e_{l}z_{l}y^{\perp}_{l}}{\sum\limits_{l}e_{l}z_{l}x^{\perp}_{l}} = 
\frac{\sum\limits_{l}e_{l}\left(\sum\limits_{n}s_{ln}g_{n}\right)y^{\perp}_{n}}{\sum\limits_{l}e_{l}\left(\sum\limits_{n}s_{ln}g_{n}\right)x^{\perp}_{n}} = 
\frac{\sum\limits_{n}s_{n}g_{n}\bar{y}^{\perp}_{n}}{\sum\limits_{n}s_{n}g_{n}\bar{x}^{\perp}_{n}},\\
&=
\frac{\mbox{cov}[s_{n}\bar{y}^{\perp}_{n}, g_{n}]}{\mbox{cov}[s_{n}\bar{x}^{\perp}_{n}, g_{n}]}.
\end{aligned}
$$

$$

::: {.proposition #prop3 name="Proposition 3"}
**Proposition 3**  
$\hat{\beta}\cnvp \beta$ under relevancy condition, Assumption 1, Assumption 2: $\mathbb E\left[\sum\limits_{n}s^{2}_{n}\right]\rightarrow 0$, cov$[g_{n}, g_{n'}|\bar{\epsilon}, s]=0$.
:::  
* Relevancy: $\sum\limits_{l}e_{l}z_{l}x^{\perp}_{l}\cnvp \pi\neq 0$ as $L\rightarrow\infty$.  
* $\mathbb E\left[\sum\limits_{n}s^{2}_{n}\right]\rightarrow 0$ is dispersed shock exposure. Note Herfindal index is minimised if each share is $\frac{1}{N}$, so dispersed shocks gives a value closer to 0.  
* cov$[g_{n}, g_{n'}|\bar{\epsilon}, s]=0$ is dispersed shocks.  


## Relaxing assumptions 1, 2

::: {.proposition #prop4 name="Proposition 4"}
**Proposition 4**  
$\hat{\beta}\cnvp \beta$ under relevancy condition, Assumption 3, Assumption 4 (replaceable with Ass 5 or 6) with shift-share constructed observables $\tilde{w}_{l}=\sum\limits_{n}s_{ln}q_{n}$.
:::  
* Assumption 6: Allows many weakly uncorrelated shocks. Shocks across industries can be correlated but only weakly, or with some upper bound.  

## Extensions

### Estimated shocks

Use leave one out IV estimator. Because, if $z_{l}$ is measured with errors, $z_{l}$ includes structural errors $\epsilon_{l}$ and induces a correlation with residuals. 
\[
z^{LOO}_{l}=\sum_{n}s_{ln}g_{n,-l}, \quad
g_{n,-l}=\frac{\sum\limits_{l'\neq l}\omega_{l'n}g_{nl'}}{\sum\limits_{l'\neq l}\omega_{l'n}}.
\]

### Incomplete shares

Use $S_{l}=\sum\limits_{n}s_{nl}$ as a covariate. If a location has a zero exposure share in the industry with shocks, sum of exposure share does not add up to one. $S_{l}$'s differ by location $l$.  

* Consider industry $n=0$ with the missing shock $g_{0}=0$. Then, Ass 3 is violated because it requires $\mathbb E[g_{n}|s, \bar{\epsilon}]=0$ for $n=0$ and $\mathbb E[g_{n}|s, \bar{\epsilon}]=0$ for $n>0$.  
* Let $\mathbb E[g_{n}|s, \bar{\epsilon}]=0$ for $n=0$ and $\mathbb E[g_{n}|s, \bar{\epsilon}]\neq 0$ for $n>0$. That is, condition $n>0$ for the covariate to have different means so the difference in shocks is accounted for in estimating impacts on $y_{l}$. This is done by conditioning on $S_{l}=\sum\limits_{n}s_{nl}I[n>0]$.  
* It suffices to control for $S_{l}$, assuming $S_{l}$ is exogenous.
\[
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{n=0}^{N}s_{n}g_{n}\bar{\epsilon}_{n}
&=\mathbb E\left[\sum_{n=0}^{N}s_{n}(g_{n}-\mu)\bar{\epsilon}_{n}\right] + \omicron_{p}(1),\\
&=
-\mu\mathbb E\left[s_{0}\bar{\epsilon}_{0}\right] + \omicron_{p}(1),\\
&=
-\mu\mathbb E\left[\sum\limits_{l}e_{l}(1-S_{l})\epsilon_{l}\right] + \omicron_{p}(1), \quad \because \sum_{n=0}^{N}s_{nl}=s_{0l}+\sum_{n=1}^{N}s_{nl}=s_{0l}+S_{l}=1\\
&\cnvp 
0 \quad \mbox{if $S_{l}$ is exogenous.}
\end{aligned}
\]

### Panel

* Consistency follows in short panels (fixed $N, T$ with $L\rightarrow\infty$) and long panels ($T\rightarrow\infty$, $N, L$ fixed and small).  
* Need to include $S_{lt}$ as a covariate if incomplete shares. To purge time-invariant shocks and if exposure shares differ by period, one needs to deflate/control with sum of exposure shares in each period.  
  * Same as "Period FE $\times S_{l}$."
* Can also do FD-IV:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta y_{lt}
&=
\beta\Delta x_{lt}+\gamma'\Delta w_{lt}+\delta \epsilon_{lt},\\
z^{FD}_{lt}
&=
\sum_{n}s_{ln, t-1}\Delta g_{nt}.
\end{aligned}
$$

### Falsification tests 

* Use observation-level confounders $r_{l}$, shock-level confounders $r_{n}$: Baseline characteristics of $l$ or $n$, pre-trend of $y_{l}$.  
* Regress $r_{l}$ on $z_{l}$ or $g_{n}$ to show confounders are not correlated with IV nor driving shocks.  
$$
\begin{aligned}
r_{l}
&=
a_{0}+a_{1}z_{l}+a_{2}w_{l}+\eta_{al},\\
r_{l}
&=
b_{0}+b_{1}x_{l}+b_{2}w_{l}+\eta_{bl}, \quad \mbox{IV with }z_{l}.\\
r_{n}
&=
c_{0}+c_{1}g_{n}+\eta_{cn},\\
\tilde{r}_{l}
&=
d_{0}+d_{1}z_{l}+d_{2}w_{l}+\eta_{dl}, \quad \tilde{r}_{l}=\sum_{n}s_{ln}r_{n}.\\
\tilde{r}_{l}
&=
h_{0}+h_{1}x_{l}+h_{2}w_{l}+\eta_{hl}, \quad \mbox{IV with }z_{l}.\\
\end{aligned}

* Repeated cross section of:  
  * 722 commuting zones $l$  
  * 397 4 digit SIC manufacturing industries  
  * 2 periods, 1990-2000, 2000-2007.  

$y_{lt}$: Changes in total manufacturing employment as \% of working age population  

$x_{lt}$: Exposure to imports from China  
$$
x_{lt}=\sum_{n}s_{lnt}^{\mbox{current}}g_{nt}^{\mbox{US}}, \quad 
g_{nt}^{\mbox{US}}=\frac{\Delta \mbox{manuf imports}_{nt}}{n\mbox{'s emp at start of }t}.
$$

$z_{lt}$: IV for $x_{lt}$  
$$
z_{lt}=\sum_{n}s_{ln,t-10}g_{nt}, \quad 
g_{nt}=\frac{\Delta \mbox{manuf imports in 8 countries}_{nt}}{n\mbox{'s emp in US 10 years ago}}.
$$
Origins of shocks $g_{nt}$: China, 8 countries other than US. Local labour supply shocks are not included.  

$w_{lt}$: Controls, including: start of period labour force demographics, period FE, census region FEs, start of perod total manufacturing shares  

$e_{lt}$: Start of period population  

Sum of lagged manufacturing shares $S_{lt}=\sum\limits_{n}s_{lnt}$ is not constant across $l$: ``incomplete shares'' case

A thought experiment:  

* Random TFP changes in industries in China  
$\Rightarrow$ (Ass 1) Exogeneity is satisfied.  
* Random TFP changes are not correlated between industries  
$\Rightarrow$  (Ass 2) Uncorrelated shocks is satisfied. Table 2 reports this is the case using hierarchical random effects model (11) which gives low intra-class correlations estimates.

* Large number of dispersed shocks.  
$\Rightarrow$  (Ass 2) Vanishing squared sum of shocks is satisfied. Table 1 reports this is the case if service sector is excluded from local employment.  
* Conditional random shock assignment (relaxing Ass1)  
$\Rightarrow$ (Ass 3) Table 3 Panel A show no correlation between shocks and industry level potential confounders.  Panel B shows two possible confounding. Last 2 rows of Panel B are pre-trend analysis.

  * Positive correlation with \% of foreign born population.  
  * Positive correlation with 1970's employment growth.  

```{marginfigure}
Could have said: 10 out of 12 falsifcation tests show no correlation of IVs with confounders.
```  

* Imbalance of foreign born shares and 70's growth bias estimates only if they are correlated with structural errors $\epsilon_{lt}$. Include them as a covariate.

### @ChristianBarrett2017: Critisims on @NunnQian2014 as not valid IV

* Mean conflict, mean wheat aid, and US wheat production follow a similar inverted-U shape trend for countries that receive food aid most often. This suggests wheat production IV is invalid. 
* CB argue that region-year, country FEs and linear time trend do not eliminate this source of endogeneity.

* State wise wage growth of industry $n$ affects gender wage gaps as certain industries are dominated with men/women. The wage growth of female-labour-intrensive industry increases the female wages relative to men. The identification assumption is that industrty-by-state wise wage growth should be orthogonal to population traits that may be correlated with domestic violence.

$z_{lt}=\sum\limits_{n}s_{lnt}g_{nt}$  

* Estimation specification uses any mineral operating in cell $l$, not the weighted average, thereby imposing the same coefficient for 14 different minerals.
